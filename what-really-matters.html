              <h3>What really matters to you?</h3>
              <p>Think about the five people closest to you. Do you know what their biggest concerns are? It's a question I've been starting to ask a lot of people close to me lately. Why? Because I honestly didn't know. I knew their stances on issues, I knew their political affiliation, but I didn't know what things they really prioritized.</p>

              <p>It's currently 24 hours before the next president of the United States is announced. Between the jokes about emigrating and the overall disappointment, there is a lingering air leaving all of us wondering if this is even real. I know for me, with whatever happens tomorrow, and whatever we'll have to deal with for the next four to eight years, I will always remember this election cycle. Because I realized what was important.</p>

              <p>Back to the original question. What issues are you deeply passionate about? Is it immigration? Social justice? Foreign affairs? Maybe your just wondering what happened to the job you were supposed to have by now. I want you to really think about it. Ask yourself why that's such an important issue to you. Maybe you agree with Trump's wall. But really ask yourself why. Are you concerned about the drugs being brought in? Or maybe it's a matter of the $24 billion being sent back by those who immigrated? Or maybe you really don't want to learn Spanish. I don't know. You do.</p>

              <p>For me, I've narrowed it down to four majors issues; the economy, healthcare reform, education, and social justice. For now, I'll start with the economy. So exciting right? I'd say 90% of my friends/family immediately have their eyes glaze over when I start talking economics. I never understood that. It's the one topic that affects every person in the United States and the one topic that every person should familiarize themselves with. Don't worry, I'll get off my soapbox soon enough.</p>

              <h3>The free market doesn't exist</h3>
              <p>If you listen to the talking heads on the news you'll catch the following argument being spewed over and over again: "the government should not interfere in the free market." This argument really is moot and has been beat to death by now, but I'd really like to just shed some light on the things that get ignored.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">

              <p>This whole argument is really a waste of time in general. The free market is an academic model to describe a perfect system where there is no barrier to entry, equal products, and many buyers and sellers. Think the board game Monopoly. There is no market that has ever existed like that, yet any attempt to regulate business is taken as an attack on capitalism and infringement on the free market. Even though it has literally never existed, ever.</p>

              <p>With that being said, there are still many decisions we have to make as a society in order to operate in a capitalist system. Decisions like how contracts are enforced, how to prevent someone from stealing ideas i.e. copyright laws, or how to prevent people from being taken advantage of. All of these things need to be decided and have no infringement on the operation of the "free market". However, most people are so distracted by the pointless argument that they miss the fact that many of these decisions have been made in favor of the wealthy and powerful. If you don't believe me maybe you'll believe Mickey Mouse.</p>

              <p>In 1928, when Mickey Mouse was created, copyrights could last up to a total of 56 years, giving Mickey until 1984. In 1976 congress lengthened that duration to the author's life plus 50 years, 75 years for corporate works, so now Mickey has until 2003. Now it's 1998, five years before the expiration, and congress passes another bill that extends works to the life of the author plus 70 years and extends copyrights for corporate works to 95 years from the year of first publication, or 120 years from the year of creation, whichever expires first. Now Disney has until 2023 to get it extended again. Who does this really benefit? Oh yeah, I almost forgot. When copyright laws were created it was originally 14 years.</p>

              <p>So why does this matter to you? It doesn't really. Not in the immediate context at least. You probably love Mickey and Disney. But, it's a good illustration of how things are shaped in the political economy. Where this really matters is when it comes to patents on pharmaceuticals, technologies, and even crop seeds. Without the extensions of copyright and patent laws, there could be less expensive and equally effective alternatives out there that we're missing out on, in part, because of a cartoon mouse.</p>
