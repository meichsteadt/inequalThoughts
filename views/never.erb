        <div class="col-md-6"><p>As I write this, I am sitting in an airport, next to a man who looks to be 90. I have never spoken to this man, but I have nothing but the utmost respect for him, a level of respect that I save for a select few. He sits with a certain quiet peace as if he has been through hell and has no qualms about going back. He is small in stature, with liver spots on decorating his skin, and his hat, it reads WW2 veteran.</p>
        <p>I have no illusions about this man. He most likely voted for Donald Trump. There's a chance he is prejudiced or intolerant, or that he only fought due to the draft, but it doesn't matter. What he fought for, what he fought against, and what he represents is all that matters. He fought the ultimate evil. He fought for humanity. He fought, truly, for freedom. And the only way I could possibly repay him is to do the same.</p>
        <p>It starts with a choice. Subtle, silent. It's a choice to not sit idly by and watch those who are helpless and afraid be continuously tyrannized. To do what you can to make the change we need. This was the year of change. Bernie Sanders inspired an entire generation of voters and it showed in how millennials voted, Hillary would have won over 500 electorate votes had only millennials voted. Now we're left to pick up the torch that has been lit and continue to champion civil rights and noble causes.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>In all of this, we can still take pride in multiple, crucial statements. The above-mentioned voting pattern should provide hope. Young people sent a message saying "We will not accept hate". The future is bright. We will get through the darkness, we will get through the hate, we will fight for what we believe in, and we will continue to build a brighter future.</p>

          <p>The title of this post is a quote from a speech given by Winston Churchill during WW2. Its entirety reads "Never was so much owed by so many to so few". I believe it works in our current context as well. It will be a small group of us to do what it takes to make tomorrow better. To champions causes. To become the role models that inspire another generation to follow our lead. To do whatever it takes to repay those who truly, genuinely fought for the future. Just like the man next to me did.</p>
